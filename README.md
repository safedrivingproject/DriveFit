### 司機與乘客的守護神

根據警方交通報告，香港每年多達 25% 的交通意外都是司機駕駛不留神所致。有見及此，我們運用了 Flutter、Google ML Kit、SQLite 與 Firebase 等技術編寫了「DriveFit 智駕勢」這個旨在保障乘客及司機安全的手機應用程式，為司機以及運輸相關行業公司提供一個廣泛、有效率，並可靠的系統，協助司機安全駕駛，並減低發生交通意外的機會。

DriveFit 有兩個主要功能：
 
(1) AI 實時駕駛提醒：
DriveFit 會透過人工智能鏡頭在背景偵測司機頭部動作，當司機打瞌睡或分心時會發出提醒；如果司機沒反應，更會提醒乘客檢查司機狀況。另外，DriveFit 亦會提醒司機要適時休息，以及在雨天時注意路面濕滑，減慢速度。
 
(2) 統計司機駕駛情況，提供詳細回饋：
運輸相關行業公司可以請司機將 DriveFit 連結至 Firebase 實時資料庫，讓司機的駕駛資料（如分心次數及時間）即時上載至雲端。公司便可以實時得知司機駕駛詳情，透過數據來制定相應的改進策略。此外，DriveFit 亦會顯示司機的分心頻率及相關趨勢，並計算出分數與評級，令司機得到鼓勵及更明白需要改進的地方。
 
於未來，我們希望與保險公司及運輸部門合作，推廣安全駕駛獎勵計劃，並邀請更多專業司機使用 DriveFit。我們相信 DriveFit 備有市場潛力，能有效保障大眾的安全。

### Your personal smart driving assistant

Police traffic reports reveal that inattentive driving causes as many as 25% of traffic accidents in Hong Kong each year. In view of this, we have developed "DriveFit", a mobile app using technologies such as Flutter, Google ML Kit, SQLite and Firebase. DriveFit aims to safeguard the safety of passengers and drivers by providing a comprehensive, efficient and reliable system for drivers and transportation companies. It assists drivers in driving safely and reduces the chance of traffic accidents.

DriveFit has two main functions:

(1) AI Real-time Driving Alerts:
DriveFit uses AI to monitor the driver's head movements in the background. DriveFit will send an alert if the driver dozes off or gets distracted. If the driver still does not respond, DriveFit will remind passengers in the backseat to check on the driver. DriveFit also reminds drivers to take breaks regularly and to slow down on rainy days with slippery roads.

(2) Driver performance statistics and detailed feedback:
Transportation companies can connect driver’s DriveFit account to the Firebase real-time database, enabling driving data (such as inattentive frequency and time) to be uploaded to the cloud. Companies can then monitor drivers' performance and develop improvement strategies based on the data. DriveFit also displays drivers' distraction frequency and related trends, calculates scores, and provides ratings, encouraging drivers and helping them understand areas that need improvement.

In the future, we aim to collaborate with insurance companies and transportation departments to launch safe driving reward programs, as well as invite more professional drivers to use DriveFit. We believe DriveFit has significant market potential and can safeguard road safety.
